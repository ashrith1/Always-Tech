              <h1> Lg may  stop its production of its smartphones due to its poor sales</h1>
              <p>G has seemingly decided to shutter its smartphone business after several attempts to survive the competition.<br> A new report by The Korea Times has said that LG will be moving its employees of the smartphone business unit to<br> other departments. And while the transition may be happening quietly and internally, LG is likely to make a formal announcement on Monday,<br> April 5. The South Korean company has been striving hard to retain its phone business,<br> but it has been more or less unsuccessful in making it big for about six years consecutively.

                The last time LG made a profit off its smartphone business unit was six years ago.<br> Since then LG’s efforts towards <br>its phone portfolio have been nothing but a waste. In fact,<br> back in January this year, LG confirmed that it is exploring options for its phone business,<br> including sale, withdrawal, and downsizing it.<br> There were reports last year that LG would sell its low-end phone business to its partner manufacturing companies while top-end <br>phone lines such as Velvet and Wing will continue.<br> But even these two phones could not bring about any good fortune.<br>
                
                “LG has considered various options such as a sale, split sales or pulling out of the <br>smartphone business, but decided recently to pull out of the business,”<br> the report said, citing some industry<br> sources.
                
                After the report came out, an LG spokesperson gave a statement to Android Central, saying, “There's nothing to comment on.” <br>The spokesperson reiterated that LG is still weighing in all possible options it has at hand<br>. But there is no official confirmation right now.<br> “Although we cannot confirm that right now, we will announce the specific direction <br>of our mobile communications business.”<br> However, the report has suggested LG will announce its decision at the upcoming board meeting <br> on April 5.</p>
